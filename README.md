# Useful Source Codes

This is a project of a **C# library** that contains a group of useful methods that I use on some **ERP systems** when I need.

## Libraries

- **Holidays**, a simple library to find holidays for a given year.
- **PersonalIDs**, a simple library to validate personal documents, e.g. RG, CPF and CNPJ.
- **TextFormat**, a simple library for string formatting.
- **ViaCEP**, a library that uses a webservice (ViaCEP) to get zip codes (CEP's) for brazilian cities.

You may use only the sources available inside each `sources` folder on each library folder, if you wish.

## Requirements

To test the files:

- **Visual Studio 2017** or above, available on https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.
- **.NET Framework 3.5** or above.
